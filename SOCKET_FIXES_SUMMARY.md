# Socket.IO Implementation - Issues Fixed

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate Disconnect Handler** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Two `socket.on('disconnect')` handlers were defined, causing the second to overwrite the first.
- First handler (lines 29-37): Removed user from onlineUsers map
- Second handler (lines 48-50): Only logged the disconnection
- Result: Online users were not being cleaned up properly

**Fix:** Merged both handlers into a single handler that:
- Removes user from onlineUsers map
- Broadcasts updated online users list
- Logs the disconnection

---

### 2. **Missing Conversation Room Management** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Users couldn't join conversation rooms to receive messages in real-time.

**Fix:** Added two new events:
- `join_conversation` - Join a conversation room to receive messages
- `leave_conversation` - Leave a conversation room
- Both events notify other users in the conversation

---

### 3. **Incomplete Typing Indicator Events** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Typing events used generic `roomId` without proper structure or context.

**Fix:** Enhanced typing events with proper data structure:
- `typing` now expects: `{ conversationId, userId, userName }`
- `stop_typing` now expects: `{ conversationId, userId, userName }`
- Added `isTyping` boolean to emitted data
- Emits to specific conversation rooms

---

### 4. **Missing Message Read Receipts** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** No socket event for read receipts.

**Fix:** Added read receipt functionality:
- New event: `message_read` (client → server)
- New event: `message_marked_read` (server → client)
- Updated `markMultipleMessagesAsRead` controller to emit socket events

---

### 5. **Missing Logging** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Limited logging made debugging difficult.

**Fix:** Added comprehensive logging:
- Socket connection events
- User join/leave events
- Conversation room join/leave events
- All with user IDs and conversation IDs

## New Socket Events

### Client → Server (Frontend emits)

#### 1. `join` - Register user as online
```javascript
socket.emit('join', 'userId-123');
```

#### 2. `join_conversation` - Join conversation room
```javascript
socket.emit('join_conversation', { 
  conversationId: 'conv-123',
  userId: 'user-123'
});
```

#### 3. `leave_conversation` - Leave conversation room
```javascript
socket.emit('leave_conversation', { 
  conversationId: 'conv-123',
  userId: 'user-123'
});
```

#### 4. `typing` - User is typing
```javascript
socket.emit('typing', { 
  conversationId: 'conv-123',
  userId: 'user-123',
  userName: 'John Doe'
});
```

#### 5. `stop_typing` - User stopped typing
```javascript
socket.emit('stop_typing', { 
  conversationId: 'conv-123',
  userId: 'user-123',
  userName: 'John Doe'
});
```

#### 6. `message_read` - Mark message as read (optional)
```javascript
socket.emit('message_read', { 
  conversationId: 'conv-123',
  messageId: 'msg-456',
  userId: 'user-123'
});
```

---

### Server → Client (Backend emits)

#### 1. `online-users` - List of online user IDs
```javascript
socket.on('online-users', (userIds) => {
  // ['123', '456', '789']
});
```

#### 2. `new_message` - New message in conversation
```javascript
socket.on('new_message', (response) => {
  // { success, message, data: { id, text, user, ... } }
});
```

#### 3. `user_typing` - Someone is typing
```javascript
socket.on('user_typing', (data) => {
  // { conversationId, userId, userName, isTyping: true }
});
```

#### 4. `user_stop_typing` - Someone stopped typing
```javascript
socket.on('user_stop_typing', (data) => {
  // { conversationId, userId, userName, isTyping: false }
});
```

#### 5. `user_joined_conversation` - User joined conversation room
```javascript
socket.on('user_joined_conversation', (data) => {
  // { conversationId, userId }
});
```

#### 6. `user_left_conversation` - User left conversation room
```javascript
socket.on('user_left_conversation', (data) => {
  // { conversationId, userId }
});
```

#### 7. `messages_marked_read` - Messages marked as read
```javascript
socket.on('messages_marked_read', (data) => {
  // { conversationId, userId, markedCount, messageIds }
});
```

## How It Works Now

### Message Flow:
1. User A sends message → API creates message in database
2. Backend emits `new_message` to conversation room
3. All users in that conversation room (User B, C, etc.) receive the message in real-time
4. User A's own client also receives the event (handle duplicates in frontend)

### Typing Indicator Flow:
1. User A types → Frontend emits `typing` after 300ms debounce
2. Backend broadcasts `user_typing` to conversation room (excluding sender)
3. Other users see "User A is typing..."
4. User A stops typing → Frontend emits `stop_typing` after 2 seconds
5. Other users see typing indicator disappear

### Online Users Flow:
1. User connects and emits `join` with their userId
2. Backend adds them to onlineUsers map and broadcasts updated list
3. All connected users see User is online
4. User disconnects → Backend removes them and broadcasts updated list

## Frontend Implementation Checklist

### Initialization
- [ ] Connect to socket.io server
- [ ] Listen for connection errors
- [ ] Listen for reconnection events
- [ ] Emit `join` event when user logs in

### Conversation Management
- [ ] Emit `join_conversation` when user opens a conversation
- [ ] Emit `leave_conversation` when user closes/navigates away from conversation
- [ ] Listen for `new_message` events
- [ ] Listen for `messages_marked_read` events

### Message Features
- [ ] Send messages via API
- [ ] Listen for `new_message` and add to UI
- [ ] Mark messages as read via API (automatically emits socket event)
- [ ] Handle duplicate messages (sender receives from API and socket)

### Typing Indicators
- [ ] Debounce typing input (300ms)
- [ ] Emit `typing` event when user types
- [ ] Set timeout to emit `stop_typing` after 2 seconds of inactivity
- [ ] Listen for `user_typing` to show indicators
- [ ] Listen for `user_stop_typing` to hide indicators

### Online Status
- [ ] Listen for `online-users` event
- [ ] Update UI to show online/offline status
- [ ] Use this to show green dots on avatars

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Two users, one conversation**
   - User A joins conversation → User B should be notified
   - User A sends message → User B receives in real-time
   - User A types → User B sees typing indicator
   - User B marks messages as read → User A sees read receipt

2. **Group conversation**
   - Multiple users join → All see each other online
   - One sends message → All receive in real-time
   - Multiple users type → All see multiple typing indicators

3. **Disconnection/Reconnection**
   - User disconnects → Should be removed from online users
   - User reconnects → Should reappear in online users
   - User should rejoin conversation rooms on reconnect

4. **Error handling**
   - Network loss → Should attempt reconnection
   - Invalid conversationId → Should handle gracefully
   - Missing userId → Should validate before emitting

---

## API Changes

### Modified Controller
**File:** `src/routes/v1/messages/messages.controllers.ts`

**`markMultipleMessagesAsRead` controller:**
- Added `myId` parameter from request body
- Added socket event emission when messages are marked as read
- Emits `messages_marked_read` event to conversation room

**Note:** The route expects `myId` in the request body for mark-as-read endpoint:
```
PATCH /api/v1/messages/mark-as-read/:conversationId
Body: { myId: "123" }
```

---

## Build and Deploy

After making changes:

1. **Build TypeScript:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Restart your server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test locally:**
   - Open multiple browser tabs
   - Connect as different users
   - Test message sending and receiving
   - Test typing indicators
   - Test online/offline status
